-DO NOT STEAL THIS BOT OR ANY SCRIPTS FROM IT-
If you're thinkin about taking anything from this, at least ask lol.

Genshin Sources are pulled from:
https://github.com/genshindev/api
https://api.genshin.dev/
for the most part. Some images that werent found on here were found elsewhere (like saved off some wikis or something.)

The genshin core of this bot currently is based on the "Genshin Card Game" discord bot. Though his bot is made from JS rather than python,
I felt that remaking his bot with what I felt more comfortable with would prove a good learning opportunity. Of course I've taken a hard focus on polishing 
simple aspects of the bot before adding large new features so in terms of features it is behind.

Feel free to DM me on discord @[Sonzee {my gf numba 1}#7276] if you have any questions about this bot or idk what else you'd want to ask me about.
You can also email me at johnniezho@gmail.com, but not sure how often I really check my emails.
